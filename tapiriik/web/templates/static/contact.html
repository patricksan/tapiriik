    <p>Unfortunately, nowadays too many people use tapiriik to promise 1-on-1 support for synchronization problems any more - there's only one of me and a whole lot more of you!</p>
    <p>If you are having issues with your account, <b>please check <a href="{% url 'activities_dashboard' %}">the activity dashboard</a></b> - it'll do its best to tell you what went wrong.</p>
    <p>If you can't resolve the issue and would like your money back, use the email below to request a refund. And, if you had emailed me previously regarding your account and never received a reply, please accept my apologies.</p>
